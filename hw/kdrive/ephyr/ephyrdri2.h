 * version of the DRI2 extension.  While it is possible to peek directly at
 * the \c XF86ModuleData from a layered module, such a module will fail to
 * load (due to an unresolved symbol) if the DRI2 extension is not loaded.

 * \param major  Location to store the major verion of the DRI2 extension
 * \param minor  Location to store the minor verion of the DRI2 extension
 *
 * \note
 * This interface was added some time after the initial release of the DRI2
 * module.  Layered modules that wish to use this interface must first test
 * its existance by calling \c xf86LoaderCheckSymbol.
